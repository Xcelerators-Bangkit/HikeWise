### Aplikasi Pendakian

Hiking is a sport that requires high skill, strength, intelligence, and endurance. This sport has also become a hobby for many people. Even so, basically, the danger when climbing a mountain is very large because it goes through terrain that has many extreme obstacles that can endanger the safety of the climbers. Physical preparation, provisions, and health need to be a particular concern for climbers. Lack of careful preparation can lead to fatal events. Such incidents as contracting hypothermia in climbers because they do not bring equipment in accordance with climbing standards. In addition, there are climbers who get lost and are confused about finding the right route because they do not carry a compass. Therefore, our team proposes a climbing preparation application for checking items with a registration feature. It is hoped that this application can help someone who will climb the mountain so that the equipment they carry meets the standards of hiking equipment. Our research questions are as follows:
 - How do climbers carry items according to climbing standards when climbing?
 - How can we simplify the mountaineering registration process?
 - How do climbers know the weather forecast during a climb?
